## Introduction

Skincare Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized skincare product recommendations to users. It utilizes collaborative filtering, specifically User-Based Collaborative Filtering, to predict user preferences based on historical interactions and suggest products that similar users have liked.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps outlined in the [Installation](#installation) section. This will guide you through setting up the necessary dependencies.

## Data

The project relies on two main datasets:
- `skincare.csv`: Contains user interactions and preferences for skincare products.
- `acie_product.csv`: Provides details about skincare products.

Make sure these datasets are available and properly formatted before running the recommendation system.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skincare-recommendation-system.git
